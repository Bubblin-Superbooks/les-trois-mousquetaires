d’Artagnan, being the more active, reached it first and placed his foot
upon it.</p><p>Cahusac immediately ran to the Guardsman whom Aramis had killed, seized

his breath, and who, for fear that d’Artagnan would kill his enemy,
wished to resume the fight.</p><p>D’Artagnan perceived that it would be disobliging Athos not to leave him
