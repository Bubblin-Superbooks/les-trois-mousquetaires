Eminence’s Guardsmen, who, still irritated by the defeat of his
companions, which had happened only the day before, had promised himself
to seize the first opportunity of avenging it. He believed this
opportunity was now come and addressed his neighbor: “It is not
astonishing that that young man should be afraid of a ball, for he is
doubtless a Musketeer apprentice.”</p><p>D’Artagnan turned round as if a serpent had stung him, and fixed his
eyes intensely upon the Guardsman who had just made this insolent
speech.</p><p>“PARDIEU,” resumed the latter, twisting his mustache, “look at me as
long as you like, my little gentleman! I have said what I have said.”</p><p>“And as since that which you have said is too clear to require any
explanation,” replied d’Artagnan, in a low voice, “I beg you to follow
me.”</p></div> </div>
