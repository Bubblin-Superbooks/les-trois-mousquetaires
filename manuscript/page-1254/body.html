the most touching ingenuousness.</p><p>“And my only heir, are you not?” said Lord de Winter in his turn, fixing
his eyes on those of Milady.</p><p>Whatever command she had over herself, Milady could not help starting;
and as in pronouncing the last words Lord de Winter placed his hand upon
the arm of his sister, this start did not escape him.</p><p>In fact, the blow was direct and severe. The first idea that occurred to
Milady’s mind was that she had been betrayed by Kitty, and that she had
recounted to the baron the selfish aversion toward himself of which she
had imprudently allowed some marks to escape before her servant. She
also recollected the furious and imprudent attack she had made upon
d’Artagnan when he spared the life of her brother.</p></div> </div>
