better satisfied with respect to two things in which he appeared to be
very much interested—his debt and his life.</p><p>At the top of the stairs, upon the most conspicuous door of the
corridor, was traced in black ink a gigantic number “1.” d’Artagnan

entered the chamber.</p><p>Porthos was in bed, and was playing a game at LANSQUENET with
Mousqueton, to keep his hand in; while a spit loaded with partridges was
turning before the fire, and on each side of a large chimneypiece, over
two chafing dishes, were boiling two stewpans, from which exhaled a
double odor of rabbit and fish stews, rejoicing to the smell. In
addition to this he perceived that the top of a wardrobe and the marble
of a commode were covered with empty bottles.</p></div> </div>
