part, made a sign of the head in proof that he acquiesced in the
proposition.</p><p>“The breakfast for these gentlemen is ready,” said the host.</p><p>“Well, bring it,” said Athos.</p><p>The host obeyed. Athos called Grimaud, pointed to a large basket which
lay in a corner, and made a sign to him to wrap the viands up in the
napkins.</p><p>Grimaud understood that it was to be a breakfast on the grass, took the
basket, packed up the viands, added the bottles, and then took the
basket on his arm.</p><p>“But where are you going to eat my breakfast?” asked the host.</p><p>“What matter, if you are paid for it?” said Athos, and he threw two
pistoles majestically on the table.</p><p>“Shall I give you the change, my officer?” said the host.</p></div> </div>
