happened to you, my Lord?”</p><p>“All is lost!” cried Buckingham, becoming as pale as a corpse; “two of
the studs are wanting, there are only ten.”</p><p>“Can you have lost them, my Lord, or do you think they have been
stolen?”</p><p>“They have been stolen,” replied the duke, “and it is the cardinal who
has dealt this blow. Hold; see! The ribbons which held them have been
cut with scissors.”</p><p>“If my Lord suspects they have been stolen, perhaps the person who stole
them still has them in his hands.”</p><p>“Wait, wait!” said the duke. “The only time I have worn these studs was
at a ball given by the king eight days ago at Windsor. The Comtesse de
Winter, with whom I had quarreled, became reconciled to me at that ball.
That reconciliation was nothing but the vengeance of a jealous woman. I
have never seen her from that day. The woman is an agent of the
cardinal.”</p></div> </div>
