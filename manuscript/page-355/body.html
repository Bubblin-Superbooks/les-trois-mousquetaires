d’Artagnan, your neighbor, with whom you had a long conference during
the day?”</p><p>“Ah, yes, Monsieur Commissary; yes, that is true, and I confess that I
was in the wrong. I did go to Monsieur d’Artagnan’s.”</p><p>“What was the aim of that visit?”</p><p>“To beg him to assist me in finding my wife. I believed I had a right to
endeavor to find her. I was deceived, as it appears, and I ask your
pardon.”</p><p>“And what did Monsieur d’Artagnan reply?”</p><p>“Monsieur d’Artagnan promised me his assistance; but I soon found out
that he was betraying me.”</p><p>“You impose upon justice. Monsieur d’Artagnan made a compact with you;
and in virtue of that compact put to flight the police who had arrested
your wife, and has placed her beyond reach.”</p></div> </div>
