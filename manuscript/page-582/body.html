rekissed twenty times the lines traced by the hand of his beautiful
mistress. At length he went to bed, fell asleep, and had golden dreams.</p><p>At seven o’clock in the morning he arose and called Planchet, who at the
second summons opened the door, his countenance not yet quite freed from
the anxiety of the preceding night.</p><p>“Planchet,” said d’Artagnan, “I am going out for all day, perhaps. You
are, therefore, your own master till seven o’clock in the evening; but
at seven o’clock you must hold yourself in readiness with two horses.”</p><p>“There!” said Planchet. “We are going again, it appears, to have our
hides pierced in all sorts of ways.”</p><p>“You will take your musketoon and your pistols.”</p><p>“There, now! Didn’t I say so?” cried Planchet. “I was sure of it—the
