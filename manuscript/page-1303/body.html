do not hear her breathe.”</p><p>“You are right,” said Felton, after having looked at Milady from the
spot on which he stood without moving a step toward her. “Go and tell

speaking a word, without making a gesture. Milady possessed that great
art, so much studied by women, of looking through her long eyelashes
without appearing to open the lids. She perceived Felton, who sat with
his back toward her. She continued to look at him for nearly ten
minutes, and in these ten minutes the immovable guardian never turned
round once.</p></div> </div>
