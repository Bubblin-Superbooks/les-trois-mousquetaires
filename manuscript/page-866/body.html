produces upon faces, according to the characters and temperaments of
those who experience it.</p><p>In the place of the fowl a dish of haricot beans made its appearanceâ€”an
enormous dish in which some bones of mutton that at first sight one
might have believed to have some meat on them pretended to show
themselves.</p><p>But the clerks were not the dupes of this deceit, and their lugubrious
looks settled down into resigned countenances.</p><p>Mme. Coquenard distributed this dish to the young men with the
moderation of a good housewife.</p><p>The time for wine came. M. Coquenard poured from a very small stone
bottle the third of a glass for each of the young men, served himself in
about the same proportion, and passed the bottle to Porthos and Mme.
