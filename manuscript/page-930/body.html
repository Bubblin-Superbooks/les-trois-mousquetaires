less you have done wrong to deceive her. In one fashion or another you
have a terrible enemy on your hands.”</p><p>While thus speaking Athos regarded with attention the sapphire set with
diamonds which had taken, on d’Artagnan’s finger, the place of the
queen’s ring, carefully kept in a casket.</p><p>“You notice my ring?” said the Gascon, proud to display so rich a gift
in the eyes of his friends.</p><p>“Yes,” said Athos, “it reminds me of a family jewel.”</p><p>“It is beautiful, is it not?” said d’Artagnan.</p><p>“Yes,” said Athos, “magnificent. I did not think two sapphires of such a
fine water existed. Have you traded it for your diamond?”</p><p>“No. It is a gift from my beautiful Englishwoman, or rather
Frenchwoman—for I am convinced she was born in France, though I have
