What for?”</p><p>“He was found in your lodging; they took him for you.”</p><p>“And by whom was he arrested?”</p><p>“By Guards brought by the men in black whom you put to flight.”</p><p>“Why did he not tell them his name? Why did he not tell them he knew
nothing about this affair?”</p><p>“He took care not to do so, monsieur; on the contrary, he came up to me
and said, ‘It is your master that needs his liberty at this moment and
not I, since he knows everything and I know nothing. They will believe
he is arrested, and that will give him time; in three days I will tell
them who I am, and they cannot fail to let me go.’”</p></div> </div>
