who will be sure not to hit me.”</p><p>In fact, at the same instant four shots were fired, and the balls were
flattened against the wall around Athos, but not one touched him.</p><p>Four shots replied to them almost instantaneously, but much better aimed
than those of the aggressors; three soldiers fell dead, and one of the
pioneers was wounded.</p><p>“Grimaud,” said Athos, still on the breach, “another musket!”</p><p>Grimaud immediately obeyed. On their part, the three friends had
reloaded their arms; a second discharge followed the first. The
brigadier and two pioneers fell dead; the rest of the troop took to
flight.</p><p>“Now, gentlemen, a sortie!” cried Athos.</p></div> </div>
