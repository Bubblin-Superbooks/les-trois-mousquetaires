young man, rely upon one who has been thirty years at court. Do not lull
yourself in security, or you will be lost; but, on the contrary—and it
is I who say it—see enemies in all directions. If anyone seeks a
quarrel with you, shun it, were it with a child of ten years old. If you
are attacked by day or by night, fight, but retreat, without shame; if
you cross a bridge, feel every plank of it with your foot, lest one
should give way beneath you; if you pass before a house which is being
built, look up, for fear a stone should fall upon your head; if you stay
out late, be always followed by your lackey, and let your lackey be
armed—if, by the by, you can be sure of your lackey. Mistrust
everybody, your friend, your brother, your mistress—your mistress above
all.”</p><p>D’Artagnan blushed.</p></div> </div>
