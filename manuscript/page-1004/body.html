can be brought back with ours.”</p><p>“Very well; but it is already five o’clock, so make haste.”</p><p>A quarter of an hour afterward Porthos appeared at the end of the Rue
Ferou on a very handsome genet. Mousqueton followed him upon an Auvergne
horse, small but very handsome. Porthos was resplendent with joy and
pride.</p><p>At the same time, Aramis made his appearance at the other end of the
street upon a superb English charger. Bazin followed him upon a roan,
holding by the halter a vigorous Mecklenburg horse; this was
d’Artagnan’s mount.</p><p>The two Musketeers met at the gate. Athos and d’Artagnan watched their
approach from the window.</p></div> </div>
