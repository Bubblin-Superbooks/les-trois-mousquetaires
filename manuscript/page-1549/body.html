dominated all the rest.</p><p>At that moment the countenance of Mme. Bonacieux became livid; a fearful
agony pervaded her frame, and she sank panting into the arms of Porthos
and Aramis.</p><p>D’Artagnan seized the hands of Athos with an anguish difficult to be
described.</p><p>“And what do you believe?’ His voice was stifled by sobs.</p><p>“I believe everything,” said Athos, biting his lips till the blood
sprang to avoid sighing.</p><p>“d’Artagnan, d’Artagnan!” cried Mme. Bonacieux, “where art thou? Do not
leave me! You see I am dying!”</p><p>D’Artagnan released the hands of Athos which he still held clasped in

agony; her glassy eyes had no longer their sight; a convulsive
shuddering shook her whole body; the sweat rolled from her brow.</p></div> </div>
