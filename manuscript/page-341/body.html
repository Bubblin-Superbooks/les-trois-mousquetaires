come back as minister, come back surrounded with guards who will defend
you, with servants who will watch over you, and then I shall no longer
fear for your days, and I shall be happy in seeing you.”</p><p>“Oh, is this true what you say?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Oh, then, some pledge of your indulgence, some object which came from
you, and may remind me that I have not been dreaming; something you have
worn, and that I may wear in my turn—a ring, a necklace, a chain.”</p><p>“Will you depart—will you depart, if I give you that you demand?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“This very instant?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p></div> </div>
