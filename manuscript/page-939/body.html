no longer joyous and alert as on the two preceding days; but on the
contrary sad as death.</p><p>D’Artagnan asked the poor girl what was the matter with her; but she, as
her only reply, drew a letter from her pocket and gave it to him.</p><p>This letter was in Milady’s handwriting; only this time it was addressed
to M. d’Artagnan, and not to M. de Wardes.</p><p>He opened it and read as follows:</p><p>Dear M. d’Artagnan, It is wrong thus to neglect your friends,
particularly at the moment you are about to leave them for so long a
time. My brother-in-law and myself expected you yesterday and the day
before, but in vain. Will it be the same this evening?</p><p>Your very grateful, Milady Clarik</p></div> </div>
