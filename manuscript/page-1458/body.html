of the letter; then, when it was ended, as if he had met with a bitter
disappointment, he asked, “Have you nothing else to say to me by the
living voice, Laporte?”</p><p>“The queen charged me to tell you to watch over yourself, for she had
advice that your assassination would be attempted.”</p><p>“And is that all—is that all?” replied Buckingham, impatiently.</p><p>“She likewise charged me to tell you that she still loved you.”</p><p>“Ah,” said Buckingham, “God be praised! My death, then, will not be to
her as the death of a stranger!”</p><p>Laporte burst into tears.</p><p>“Patrick,” said the duke, “bring me the casket in which the diamond
studs were kept.”</p></div> </div>
