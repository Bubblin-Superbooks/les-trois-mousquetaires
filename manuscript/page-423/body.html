does not suffer himself to be easily dispossessed from a place in which
he has fixed his garrison. In proportion as they redoubled the exorcisms
he redoubled the temptations; so that day and night the bell was ringing
full swing, announcing the extreme desire for mortification which the
penitent experienced.</p><p>The monks had no longer an instant of repose. By day they did nothing
but ascend and descend the steps which led to the chapel; at night, in

twenty times out of their beds and prostrate themselves on the floor of
their cells.</p><p>It is not known whether it was the devil who gave way, or the monks who
grew tired; but within three months the penitent reappeared in the world
with the reputation of being the most terrible POSSESSED that ever
existed.</p></div> </div>
