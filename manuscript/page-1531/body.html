is told how to proceed; he makes a sign to the postillion, and we set
off at a gallop.”</p><p>“But d’Artagnan! D’Artagnan! if he comes?”</p><p>“Shall we not know it?”</p><p>“How?”</p><p>“Nothing easier. We will send my brother’s servant back to Bethune,
whom, as I told you, we can trust. He shall assume a disguise, and place
himself in front of the convent. If the emissaries of the cardinal
arrive, he will take no notice; if it is Monsieur d’Artagnan and his
friends, he will bring them to us.”</p><p>“He knows them, then?”</p><p>“Doubtless. Has he not seen Monsieur d’Artagnan at my house?”</p><p>“Oh, yes, yes; you are right. Thus all may go well—all may be for the
best; but we do not go far from this place?”</p></div> </div>
