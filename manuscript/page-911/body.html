that. A poet is as good as an abbe. Ah! Monsieur Aramis, become a poet,
I beg of you.”</p><p>“Bazin, my friend,” said Aramis, “I believe you meddle with my
conversation.”</p><p>Bazin perceived he was wrong; he bowed and went out.</p><p>“Ah!” said d’Artagnan with a smile, “you sell your productions at their
weight in gold. You are very fortunate, my friend; but take care or you
will lose that letter which is peeping from your doublet, and which also
comes, no doubt, from your publisher.”</p><p>Aramis blushed to the eyes, crammed in the letter, and re-buttoned his
doublet.</p><p>“My dear d’Artagnan,” said he, “if you please, we will join our friends;
as I am rich, we will today begin to dine together again, expecting that
you will be rich in your turn.”</p></div> </div>
