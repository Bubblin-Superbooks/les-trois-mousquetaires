this adventure. Great personages may have had a hand in what you have
seen, and if talked about, the evil would only recoil upon us.”</p><p>“Ah, monsieur!” stammered Planchet, more dead than alive, “ah, monsieur,
what an escape I have had!”</p><p>“How, sirrah! you were going to drink my wine?”</p><p>“To the health of the king, monsieur; I was going to drink a small glass
of it if Fourreau had not told me I was called.”</p><p>“Alas!” said Fourreau, whose teeth chattered with terror, “I wanted to
get him out of the way that I might drink myself.”</p><p>“Gentlemen,” said d’Artagnan, addressing the Guardsmen, “you may easily
comprehend that such a feast can only be very dull after what has taken
place; so accept my excuses, and put off the party till another day, I
beg of you.”</p></div> </div>
