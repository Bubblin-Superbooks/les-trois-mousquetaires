what might become of Kitty he ran at full speed across half Paris, and
did not stop till he came to Athos’s door. The confusion of his mind,
the terror which spurred him on, the cries of some of the patrol who
started in pursuit of him, and the hooting of the people who,
notwithstanding the early hour, were going to their work, only made him
precipitate his course.</p><p>He crossed the court, ran up the two flights to Athos’s apartment, and
knocked at the door enough to break it down.</p><p>Grimaud came, rubbing his half-open eyes, to answer this noisy summons,
and d’Artagnan sprang with such violence into the room as nearly to
overturn the astonished lackey.</p><p>In spite of his habitual silence, the poor lad this time found his
speech.</p></div> </div>
