proved how much greater an interest she took in the duke than she
ventured to tell.</p><p>“I do not tell you this, madame, to terrify you; no, it is even
ridiculous for me to name it to you, and, believe me, I take no heed of
such dreams. But the words you have just spoken, the hope you have
almost given me, will have richly paid all—were it my life.”</p><p>“Oh, but I,” said Anne, “I also, duke, have had presentiments; I also
have had dreams. I dreamed that I saw you lying bleeding, wounded.”</p><p>“In the left side, was it not, and with a knife?” interrupted
Buckingham.</p><p>“Yes, it was so, my Lord, it was so—in the left side, and with a knife.
Who can possibly have told you I had had that dream? I have imparted it
to no one but my God, and that in my prayers.”</p></div> </div>
