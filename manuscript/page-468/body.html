friend. I shall soon return; and if you will wait only a few minutes for
me, as soon as I have concluded my business with that friend, as it is

whatever,” replied Mme. Bonacieux. “I shall return very safely to the
Louvre all alone.”</p><p>“As you please, Madame Bonacieux,” said the ex-mercer. “Shall I see you
again soon?”</p><p>“Next week I hope my duties will afford me a little liberty, and I will
take advantage of it to come and put things in order here, as they must
necessarily be much deranged.”</p><p>“Very well; I shall expect you. You are not angry with me?”</p><p>“Not the least in the world.”</p></div> </div>
