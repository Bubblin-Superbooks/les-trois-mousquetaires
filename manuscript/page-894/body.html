his closet; Milady called, undressed, sent away Kitty, and shut the
door. As the night before, d’Artagnan did not return home till five
o’clock in the morning.</p><p>At eleven o’clock Kitty came to him. She held in her hand a fresh billet
from Milady. This time the poor girl did not even argue with d’Artagnan;

soldier.</p><p>D’Artagnan opened the letter and read as follows:</p><p>This is the third time I have written to you to tell you that I love
you. Beware that I do not write to you a fourth time to tell you that I
detest you.</p><p>If you repent of the manner in which you have acted toward me, the young
girl who brings you this will tell you how a man of spirit may obtain
his pardon.</p></div> </div>
