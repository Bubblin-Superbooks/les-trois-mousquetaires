<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">storm.</p><p>The storm broke about ten o’clock. Milady felt a consolation in seeing
nature partake of the disorder of her heart. The thunder growled in the
air like the passion and anger in her thoughts. It appeared to her that
the blast as it swept along disheveled her brow, as it bowed the
branches of the trees and bore away their leaves. She howled as the
hurricane howled; and her voice was lost in the great voice of nature,
which also seemed to groan with despair.</p><p>All at once she heard a tap at her window, and by the help of a flash of
lightning she saw the face of a man appear behind the bars.</p><p>She ran to the window and opened it.</p><p>“Felton!” cried she. “I am saved.”</p><p>“Yes,” said Felton; “but silence, silence! I must have time to file
through these bars. Only take care that I am not seen through the
wicket.”</p></div> </div>
