question, the queen having put it in an almost dying voice.</p><p>“Oh, very shortly, madame,” said he; “but I do not precisely recollect
the date of the day. I will ask the cardinal.”</p><p>“It was the cardinal, then, who informed you of this fete?”</p><p>“Yes, madame,” replied the astonished king; “but why do you ask that?”</p><p>“It was he who told you to invite me to appear with these studs?”</p><p>“That is to say, madame—”</p><p>“It was he, sire, it was he!”</p><p>“Well, and what does it signify whether it was he or I?
