asked Aramis.</p><p>“Because, as Porthos was talking louder than the rest of us, he took him
for the chief,” said d’Artagnan.</p><p>“I always said that this cadet from Gascony was a well of wisdom,”
murmured Athos; and the travelers continued their route.</p><p>At Beauvais they stopped two hours, as well to breathe their horses a
little as to wait for Porthos. At the end of two hours, as Porthos did
not come, not any news of him, they resumed their journey.</p><p>At a league from Beauvais, where the road was confined between two high
banks, they fell in with eight or ten men who, taking advantage of the
road being unpaved in this spot, appeared to be employed in digging
holes and filling up the ruts with mud.</p></div> </div>
