ruff, a small cap upon your head of the same color as your robe, and in
that cap a heron’s feather. Hold! Hold! I shut my eyes, and I can see
you as you then were; I open them again, and I see what you are now—a

fault with the duke for having so well preserved her portrait in his
heart, “what folly to feed a useless passion with such remembrances!”</p><p>“And upon what then must I live? I have nothing but memory. It is my

only seen you four times—the first, which I have described to you; the
second, at the mansion of Madame de Chevreuse; the third, in the gardens
of Amiens.”</p></div> </div>
