would be sorry to lose?”</p><p>The handkerchief was indeed richly embroidered, and had a coronet and
arms at one of its corners. Aramis blushed excessively, and snatched
rather than took the handkerchief from the hand of the Gascon.</p><p>“Ah, ah!” cried one of the Guards, “will you persist in saying, most

Bois-Tracy, when that gracious lady has the kindness to lend you one of
her handkerchiefs?”</p><p>Aramis darted at d’Artagnan one of those looks which inform a man that
he has acquired a mortal enemy. Then, resuming his mild air, “You are
deceived, gentlemen,” said he, “this handkerchief is not mine, and I
cannot fancy why Monsieur has taken it into his head to offer it to me
rather than to one of you; and as a proof of what I say, here is mine in
my pocket.”</p></div> </div>
