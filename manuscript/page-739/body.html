rose, and preceded by the host wringing his hands, and followed by
Planchet with his musketoon ready for use, he approached the scene of
action.</p><p>The two gentlemen were exasperated; they had had a long ride, and were
dying with hunger and thirst.</p><p>“But this is tyranny!” cried one of them, in very good French, though
with a foreign accent, “that this madman will not allow these good
people access to their own wine! Nonsense, let us break open the door,
and if he is too far gone in his madness, well, we will kill him!”</p><p>“Softly, gentlemen!” said d’Artagnan, drawing his pistols from his belt,
“you will kill nobody, if you please!”</p><p>“Good, good!” cried the calm voice of Athos, from the other side of the
door, “let them just come in, these devourers of little children, and we
shall see!”</p></div> </div>
