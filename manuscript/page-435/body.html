for it, her resentment will not hold out against such an attention.”</p><p>“Monsieur Cardinal, you know that I do not like worldly pleasures.”</p><p>“The queen will only be the more grateful to you, as she knows your

to wear those beautiful diamonds which you gave her recently on her
birthday and with which she has since had no occasion to adorn herself.”</p><p>“We shall see, Monsieur Cardinal, we shall see,” said the king, who, in

make up all differences with her, “we shall see, but upon my honor, you
are too indulgent toward her.”</p></div> </div>
