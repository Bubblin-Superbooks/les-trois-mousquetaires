her adversary speak out. “What do you mean to say? Is there any secret
meaning concealed beneath your words?”</p><p>“Oh, my God, no!” said Lord de Winter, with apparent good nature. “You
wish to see me, and you come to England. I learn this desire, or rather

brings you hither to this castle, of which I am governor, whither I come
every day, and where, in order to satisfy our mutual desire of seeing
each other, I have prepared you a chamber. What is there more
astonishing in all that I have said to you than in what you have told
me?”</p><p>“No; what I think astonishing is that you should expect my coming.”</p></div> </div>
