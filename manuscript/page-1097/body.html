Musketeers shall follow us,” said he, in an undertone. “I am not willing
it should be known I have left the camp; and if they follow us we shall
be certain they will tell nobody.”</p><p>“We are gentlemen, monseigneur,” said Athos; “require our parole, and
give yourself no uneasiness. Thank God, we can keep a secret.”</p><p>The cardinal fixed his piercing eyes on this courageous speaker.</p><p>“You have a quick ear, Monsieur Athos,” said the cardinal; “but now
listen to this. It is not from mistrust that I request you to follow me,
but for my security. Your companions are no doubt Messieurs Porthos and
Aramis.”</p></div> </div>
