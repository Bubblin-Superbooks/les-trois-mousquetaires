you today, to raise all these melancholy ideas?”</p><p>“This wound, my dear d’Artagnan, has been a warning to me from heaven.”</p><p>“This wound? Bah, it is now nearly healed, and I am sure it is not that
which gives you the most pain.”</p><p>“What, then?” said Aramis, blushing.</p><p>“You have one at heart, Aramis, one deeper and more painful—a wound
made by a woman.”</p><p>The eye of Aramis kindled in spite of himself.</p><p>“Ah,” said he, dissembling his emotion under a feigned carelessness, “do
not talk of such things, and suffer love pains? VANITAS VANITATUM!
According to your idea, then, my brain is turned. And for whom-for some
GRISETTE, some chambermaid with whom I have trifled in some garrison?
Fie!”</p><p>“Pardon, my dear Aramis, but I thought you carried your eyes higher.”</p></div> </div>
