very fortunate to have lost, believe me, my dear d’Artagnan. And if I
have any counsel to give, it is, always lose!”</p><p>“She seemed to love me so!”</p><p>“She SEEMED, did she?”</p><p>“Oh, she DID love me!”</p><p>“You child, why, there is not a man who has not believed, as you do,
that his mistress loved him, and there lives not a man who has not been
deceived by his mistress.”</p><p>“Except you, Athos, who never had one.”</p><p>“That’s true,” said Athos, after a moment’s silence, “that’s true! I
never had one! Let us drink!”</p><p>“But then, philosopher that you are,” said d’Artagnan, “instruct me,
support me. I stand in need of being taught and consoled.”</p></div> </div>
