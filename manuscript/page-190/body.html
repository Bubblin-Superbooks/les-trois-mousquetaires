better,” said the king, advancing toward the door. “Ah! It is you,
Treville. Where are your Musketeers? I told you the day before yesterday
to bring them with you; why have you not done so?”</p><p>“They are below, sire, and with your permission La Chesnaye will bid
them come up.”</p><p>“Yes, yes, let them come up immediately. It is nearly eight o’clock, and
at nine I expect a visit. Go, Monsieur Duke, and return often. Come in,
Treville.”</p><p>The Duke saluted and retired. At the moment he opened the door, the
three Musketeers and d’Artagnan, conducted by La Chesnaye, appeared at
the top of the staircase.</p></div> </div>
