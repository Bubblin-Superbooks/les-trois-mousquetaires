of the Carmelites at Bethune, where I will await your orders.”</p><p>Accordingly, that same evening Milady commenced her journey. Night
overtook her; she stopped, and slept at an inn. At five o’clock the next
morning she again proceeded, and in three hours after entered Bethune.
She inquired for the convent of the Carmelites, and went thither
immediately.</p><p>The superior met her; Milady showed her the cardinal’s order. The abbess
assigned her a chamber, and had breakfast served.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">All the past was effaced from the eyes of this woman; and her looks,
fixed on the future, beheld nothing but the high fortunes reserved for
her by the cardinal, whom she had so successfully served without his
name</p></div> </div>
