roughness which women often prefer to the affectations of politeness,
because it betrays the depths of the thought and proves that feeling
prevails over reason.</p><p>“Well!” resumed Mme. Bonacieux, in a voice almost caressing, and
pressing the hand of d’Artagnan, who had not relinquished hers, “well: I
will not say as much as you do; what is lost for today may not be lost
forever. Who knows, when I shall be at liberty, that I may not satisfy
your curiosity?”</p><p>“And will you make the same promise to my love?” cried d’Artagnan,
beside himself with joy.</p><p>“Oh, as to that, I do not engage myself. That depends upon the
sentiments with which you may inspire me.”</p></div> </div>
