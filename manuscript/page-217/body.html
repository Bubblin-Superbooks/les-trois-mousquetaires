<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">commanded M. de Chevalier Dessessart to admit
d’Artagnan as a cadet in his company of Guards. D’Artagnan, with a sigh,
donned his uniform, which he would have exchanged for that of a
Musketeer at the expense of ten years of his existence. But M. de
Treville promised this favor after a novitiate of two years—a novitiate
which might besides be abridged if an opportunity should present itself
for d’Artagnan to render the king any signal service, or to distinguish
himself by some brilliant action. Upon this promise d’Artagnan withdrew,
and the next day he began service.</p><p>Then it became the turn of Athos, Porthos, and Aramis to mount guard
with d’Artagnan when he was on duty. The company of M. le Chevalier
Dessessart thus received four instead of one when it admitted
d’Artagnan.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
