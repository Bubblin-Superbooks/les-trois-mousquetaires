with his finger.</p><p>Athos recognized his comrade, and phlegmatic as he was, he burst into a
laugh which was quite excused by the strange masquerade before his
eyes—petticoats falling over his shoes, sleeves tucked up, and
mustaches stiff with agitation.</p><p>“Don’t laugh, my friend!” cried d’Artagnan; “for heaven’s sake, don’t
laugh, for upon my soul, it’s no laughing matter!”</p><p>And he pronounced these words with such a solemn air and with such a
real appearance of terror, that Athos eagerly seized his hand, crying,
“Are you wounded, my friend? How pale you are!”</p><p>“No, but I have just met with a terrible adventure! Are you alone,
Athos?”</p><p>“PARBLEU! whom do you expect to find with me at this hour?”</p></div> </div>
