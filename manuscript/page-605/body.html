Planchet all ready. The fourth horse had arrived.</p><p>Planchet was armed with his musketoon and a pistol. D’Artagnan had his
sword and placed two pistols in his belt; then both mounted and departed
quietly. It was quite dark, and no one saw them go out. Planchet took
place behind his master, and kept at a distance of ten paces from him.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">D’Artagnan crossed the quays, went out by the gate</p></div> </div>
