  "page-25": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">nor did the sword issue from its\nscabbard. It was not that the sight of the wretched pony did not excite\nnumerous smiles on the countenances of passers-by; but as against the\nside of this pony rattled a sword of respectable length, and as over\nthis sword gleamed an eye rather ferocious than haughty, these\npassers-by repressed their hilarity, or if hilarity prevailed over\nprudence, they endeavored to laugh only on one side, like the masks of\nthe ancients. D’Artagnan, then, remained majestic and intact in his\nsusceptibility, till he came to this unlucky city of Meung.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">But there, as he was alighting from his horse at the gate of the Jolly\nMiller, without anyone—host, waiter, or hostler—coming to hold his\nstirrup or take his horse, d’Artagnan spied, though an open window on\nthe ground floor, a gentleman, well-made and of good carriage, although\nof rather a stern countenance, talking with two persons who appeared to\nlisten to him with</p>",
  "page-26": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">respect. D’Artagnan fancied quite naturally,\naccording to his custom, that he must be the object of their\nconversation, and listened. This time d’Artagnan was only in part\nmistaken; he himself was not in question, but his horse was. The\ngentleman appeared to be enumerating all his qualities to his auditors;\nand, as I have said, the auditors seeming to have great deference for\nthe narrator, they every moment burst into fits of laughter. Now, as a\nhalf-smile was sufficient to awaken the irascibility of the young man,\nthe effect produced upon him by this vociferous mirth may be easily\nimagined.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Nevertheless, d’Artagnan was desirous of examining the appearance of\nthis impertinent personage who ridiculed him. He fixed his haughty eye\nupon the stranger, and perceived a man of from forty to forty-five years\nof age, with black and piercing eyes, pale complexion, a strongly marked\nnose, and a black and</p>",
  "page-27": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">well-shaped mustache. He was dressed in a doublet\nand hose of a violet color, with aiguillettes of the same color, without\nany other ornaments than the customary slashes, through which the shirt\nappeared. This doublet and hose, though new, were creased, like\ntraveling clothes for a long time packed in a portmanteau. D’Artagnan\nmade all these remarks with the rapidity of a most minute observer, and\ndoubtless from an instinctive feeling that this stranger was destined to\nhave a great influence over his future life.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Now, as at the moment in which d’Artagnan fixed his eyes upon the\ngentleman in the violet doublet, the gentleman made one of his most\nknowing and profound remarks respecting the Bearnese pony, his two\nauditors laughed even louder than before, and he himself, though\ncontrary to his custom, allowed a pale smile (if I may be allowed to use\nsuch an expression) to stray over his countenance. This time there could\nbe no</p>",
  "page-28": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">doubt; d’Artagnan was really insulted. Full, then, of this\nconviction, he pulled his cap down over his eyes, and endeavoring to\ncopy some of the court airs he had picked up in Gascony among young\ntraveling nobles, he advanced with one hand on the hilt of his sword and\nthe other resting on his hip. Unfortunately, as he advanced, his anger\nincreased at every step; and instead of the proper and lofty speech he\nhad prepared as a prelude to his challenge, he found nothing at the tip\nof his tongue but a gross personality, which he accompanied with a\nfurious gesture.</p><p>“I say, sir, you sir, who are hiding yourself behind that shutter—yes,\nyou, sir, tell me what you are laughing at, and we will laugh together!”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The gentleman raised his eyes slowly from the nag to his cavalier, as if\nhe required some time to ascertain whether it could be to him that such\nstrange reproaches were addressed; then, when he could not</p>",

His quiet\nmanner and the ironical expression of his countenance redoubled the\nmirth of the persons with whom he had been talking, and who still\nremained at the window.</p><p>D’Artagnan, seeing him approach, drew his sword a foot out of the\nscabbard.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“This horse is decidedly, or rather has been in his youth, a buttercup,”\nresumed the stranger, continuing</p>",

This caused so rapid and complete a diversion from\nthe attack that d’Artagnan’s adversary, while the latter turned round to\nface this shower of blows, sheathed his sword with the same precision,\nand instead of an actor, which he had nearly been, became a spectator of\nthe fight—a part in which he acquitted himself with his usual\nimpassiveness, muttering, nevertheless, “A plague upon these Gascons!\nReplace him on his orange horse, and let him begone!”</p><p>“Not before I have killed you, poltroon!” cried d’Artagnan, making the\nbest face possible, and never retreating one step before his three\nassailants, who continued to shower blows upon him.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Another gasconade!” murmured the gentleman.</p>",

In short, up to this period nothing had been wanting to\nTreville but opportunity; but he was ever on the watch for it, and he\nfaithfully promised himself that he would not fail to seize it by its\nthree hairs whenever it came within reach of his hand.

Nevertheless, he pressed\nd’Artagnan’s hand, and said to him: “You are an honest youth; but at the\npresent moment I can only do for you that which I just now offered.

D’Artagnan, on the contrary, quite full of his plans of\nconciliation and</p>",

He was seeking in his\nmind, then, for the least awkward means of retreat, when he remarked\nthat Aramis had let his handkerchief fall, and by mistake, no doubt, had\nplaced his foot upon it. This appeared to be a favorable opportunity to\nrepair his intrusion. He stooped, and with the most gracious air he\ncould assume, drew the handkerchief from under the foot of the Musketeer\nin spite of the efforts the latter made to detain it, and holding it out\nto him, said, “I</p>",
  "page-117": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">believe, monsieur, that this is a handkerchief you\nwould be sorry to lose?”</p><p>The handkerchief was indeed richly embroidered, and had a coronet and\narms at one of its corners.

Then, resuming his mild air, “You are\ndeceived, gentlemen,” said he, “this handkerchief is not mine, and I\ncannot fancy why Monsieur has taken it into his head to offer it to me\nrather than to one of you; and as a proof of what I say, here is mine in\nmy pocket.”</p>",
  "page-118": "<p>So saying, he pulled out his own handkerchief, likewise a very elegant\nhandkerchief, and of fine cambric—though cambric was dear at the\nperiod—but a handkerchief without embroidery and without arms, only\nornamented with a single cipher, that of its proprietor.</p><p>This time d’Artagnan was not hasty. He perceived his mistake; but the\nfriends of Aramis were not at all convinced by his denial, and one of\nthem addressed the young Musketeer with affected seriousness. “If it\nwere as you pretend it is,” said he, “I should be forced, my dear\nAramis, to reclaim it myself; for, as you very well know, Bois-Tracy is\nan intimate friend of mine, and I cannot allow the property of his wife\nto be sported as a trophy.”</p><p>“You make the demand badly,” replied Aramis; “and while acknowledging\nthe justice of your reclamation, I refuse it on account of the form.”</p>",
  "page-119": "<p>“The fact is,” hazarded d’Artagnan, timidly, “I did not see the\nhandkerchief fall from the pocket of Monsieur Aramis. He had his foot\nupon it, that is all; and I thought from having his foot upon it the\nhandkerchief was his.”</p><p>“And you were deceived, my dear sir,” replied Aramis, coldly, very\nlittle sensible to the reparation. Then turning toward that one of the\nguards who had declared himself the friend of Bois-Tracy, “Besides,”\ncontinued he, “I have reflected, my dear intimate of Bois-Tracy, that I\nam not less tenderly his friend than you can possibly be; so that\ndecidedly this handkerchief is as likely to have fallen from your pocket\nas mine.”</p><p>“No, upon my honor!” cried his Majesty’s Guardsman.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“You are about to swear upon your honor and I upon my word, and then it\nwill be pretty evident that one of us will have lied.

  "page-121": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">me, I hope.”</p><p>“Ah, monsieur,” interrupted Aramis, “permit me to observe to you that\nyou have not acted in this affair as a gallant man ought.”</p><p>“What, monsieur!” cried d’Artagnan, “and do you suppose—”</p><p>“I suppose, monsieur, that you are not a fool, and that you knew very\nwell, although coming from Gascony, that people do not tread upon\nhandkerchiefs without a reason.

  "page-122": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">are convinced that they have done already at\nleast as much again as they ought to have done.”</p><p>“Monsieur, what I say to you about the matter,” said Aramis, “is not for\nthe sake of seeking a quarrel.

In the midst of his amorous\nprojects for the mercer’s wife, he did not forget his friends. The\npretty Mme. Bonacieux was just the woman to walk with in the Plain St.\nDenis or in the fair of St. Germain, in company with Athos, Porthos, and\nAramis, to whom d’Artagnan had often remarked this. Then one could enjoy\ncharming little dinners, where one touches on one side the hand of a\nfriend, and on the other the foot of a mistress. Besides, on pressing\noccasions, in extreme difficulties, d’Artagnan would become the\npreserver of his friends.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">And M.

If d’Artagnan forgets his host, or\nappears to forget him, under the pretense of not knowing where he has\nbeen carried, we will not forget him, and we know where he is.

As he found himself\nin the quarter in which Aramis lived, he took it into his head to pay\nhis friend a visit in order to explain the motives which had led him to\nsend Planchet with a request that he would come instantly to the\nmousetrap. Now, if</p>",

This mystery required an\nexplanation; at least, so d’Artagnan declared to himself.</p><p>He likewise thought this was an opportunity for talking about pretty\nlittle Mme. Bonacieux, of whom his head, if not his heart, was already\nfull. We must never look for discretion in first love. First love is\naccompanied by such excessive joy that unless the joy be allowed to\noverflow, it will stifle you.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Paris for two hours past had been dark, and seemed a desert. Eleven\no’clock sounded from all the clocks of the Faubourg St. Germain. It was\ndelightful weather. D’Artagnan was passing along a lane on the spot\nwhere the Rue d’Assas is now situated, breathing the balmy emanations\nwhich were borne upon the wind from the</p>",
  "page-289": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Rue de Vaugirard, and which\narose from the gardens refreshed by the dews of evening and the breeze\nof night. From a distance resounded, deadened, however, by good\nshutters, the songs of the tipplers, enjoying themselves in the cabarets\nscattered along the plain. Arrived at the end of the lane, d’Artagnan\nturned to the left. The house in which Aramis dwelt was situated between\nthe Rue Cassette and the Rue Servandoni.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">D’Artagnan had just passed the Rue Cassette, and already perceived the\ndoor of his friend’s house, shaded by a mass of sycamores and clematis\nwhich formed a vast arch opposite the front of it, when he perceived\nsomething like a shadow issuing from the Rue Servandoni. This something\nwas enveloped in a cloak, and d’Artagnan at first believed it was a man;\nbut by the smallness of the form, the hesitation of the walk, and the\nindecision of the step, he soon discovered that it was a woman. Further,\nthis woman, as if not certain of the</p>",
  "page-290": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">house she was seeking, lifted up\nher eyes to look around her, stopped, went backward, and then returned\nagain. D’Artagnan was perplexed.</p><p>“Shall I go and offer her my services?” thought he. “By her step she\nmust be young; perhaps she is pretty. Oh, yes! But a woman who wanders\nin the streets at this hour only ventures out to meet her lover. If I\nshould disturb a rendezvous, that would not be the best means of\ncommencing an acquaintance.”</p><p>Meantime the young woman continued to advance, counting the houses and\nwindows. This was neither long nor difficult. There were but three\nhotels in this part of the street; and only two windows looking toward\nthe road, one of which was in a pavilion parallel to that which Aramis\noccupied, the other belonging to Aramis himself.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“PARIDIEU!” said d’Artagnan to himself, to whose mind the niece of the\ntheologian reverted, “PARDIEU,</p>",
  "page-291": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">it would be droll if this belated dove\nshould be in search of our friend’s house. But on my soul, it looks so.\nAh, my dear Aramis, this time I shall find you out.” And d’Artagnan,\nmaking himself as small as he could, concealed himself in the darkest\nside of the street near a stone bench placed at the back of a niche.</p><p>The young woman continued to advance; and in addition to the lightness\nof her step, which had betrayed her, she emitted a little cough which\ndenoted a sweet voice. D’Artagnan believed this cough to be a signal.</p><p>Nevertheless, whether the cough had been answered by a similar signal\nwhich had fixed the irresolution of the nocturnal seeker, or whether\nwithout this aid she saw that she had arrived at the end of her journey,\nshe resolutely drew near to Aramis’s shutter, and tapped, at three equal\nintervals, with her bent finger.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“This is all very fine, dear Aramis,” murmured d’Artagnan. “Ah, Monsieur\nHypocrite, I understand</p>",
  "page-292": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">how you study theology.”</p><p>The three blows were scarcely struck, when the inside blind was opened\nand a light appeared through the panes of the outside shutter.</p><p>“Ah, ah!” said the listener, “not through doors, but through windows!\nAh, this visit was expected. We shall see the windows open, and the lady\nenter by escalade. Very pretty!”</p><p>But to the great astonishment of d’Artagnan, the shutter remained\nclosed. Still more, the light which had shone for an instant\ndisappeared, and all was again in obscurity.</p><p>D’Artagnan thought this could not last long, and continued to look with\nall his eyes and listen with all his ears.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">He was right; at the end of some seconds two sharp taps were heard\ninside. The young woman in the street replied by a single tap, and the\nshutter was opened a</p>",
  "page-293": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">little way.</p><p>It may be judged whether d’Artagnan looked or listened with avidity.\nUnfortunately the light had been removed into another chamber; but the\neyes of the young man were accustomed to the night. Besides, the eyes of\nthe Gascons have, as it is asserted, like those of cats, the faculty of\nseeing in the dark.</p><p>D’Artagnan then saw that the young woman took from her pocket a white\nobject, which she unfolded quickly, and which took the form of a\nhandkerchief. She made her interlocutor observe the corner of this\nunfolded object.</p><p>This immediately recalled to d’Artagnan’s mind the handkerchief which he\nhad found at the feet of Mme. Bonacieux, which had reminded him of that\nwhich he had dragged from under the feet of Aramis.</p><p>“What the devil could that handkerchief signify?”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Placed where he was, d’Artagnan could not perceive</p>",
  "page-294": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">the face of Aramis.\nWe say Aramis, because the young man entertained no doubt that it was\nhis friend who held this dialogue from the interior with the lady of the\nexterior. Curiosity prevailed over prudence; and profiting by the\npreoccupation into which the sight of the handkerchief appeared to have\nplunged the two personages now on the scene, he stole from his hiding\nplace, and quick as lightning, but stepping with utmost caution, he ran\nand placed himself close to the angle of the wall, from which his eye\ncould pierce the interior of Aramis’s room.</p><p>Upon gaining this advantage d’Artagnan was near uttering a cry of\nsurprise; it was not Aramis who was conversing with the nocturnal\nvisitor, it was a woman! D’Artagnan, however, could only see enough to\nrecognize the form of her vestments, not enough to distinguish her\nfeatures.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">At the same instant the woman inside drew a second</p>",
  "page-295": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">handkerchief from her\npocket, and exchanged it for that which had just been shown to her. Then\nsome words were spoken by the two women. At length the shutter closed.\nThe woman who was outside the window turned round, and passed within\nfour steps of d’Artagnan, pulling down the hood of her mantle; but the\nprecaution was too late, d’Artagnan had already recognized Mme.\nBonacieux.</p><p>Mme. Bonacieux! The suspicion that it was she had crossed the mind of\nd’Artagnan when she drew the handkerchief from her pocket; but what\nprobability was there that Mme. Bonacieux, who had sent for M. Laporte\nin order to be reconducted to the Louvre, should be running about the\nstreets of Paris at half past eleven at night, at the risk of being\nabducted a second time?</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">This must be, then, an affair of importance; and what is the most\nimportant affair to a woman of</p>",
  "page-296": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">twenty-five! Love.</p><p>But was it on her own account, or on account of another, that she\nexposed herself to such hazards? This was a question the young man asked\nhimself, whom the demon of jealousy already gnawed, being in heart\nneither more nor less than an accepted lover.</p><p>There was a very simple means of satisfying himself whither Mme.\nBonacieux was going; that was to follow her. This method was so simple\nthat d’Artagnan employed it quite naturally and instinctively.</p><p>But at the sight of the young man, who detached himself from the wall\nlike a statue walking from its niche, and at the noise of the steps\nwhich she heard resound behind her, Mme. Bonacieux uttered a little cry\nand fled.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">D’Artagnan ran after her. It was not difficult for him to overtake a\nwoman embarrassed with her cloak. He came up with her before she had\ntraversed a third of</p>",
  "page-297": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">the street. The unfortunate woman was exhausted,\nnot by fatigue, but by terror, and when d’Artagnan placed his hand upon\nher shoulder, she sank upon one knee, crying in a choking voice, “Kill\nme, if you please, you shall know nothing!”</p><p>D’Artagnan raised her by passing his arm round her waist; but as he felt\nby her weight she was on the point of fainting, he made haste to\nreassure her by protestations of devotedness. These protestations were\nnothing for Mme. Bonacieux, for such protestations may be made with the\nworst intentions in the world; but the voice was all. Mme. Bonacieux\nthought she recognized the sound of that voice; she reopened her eyes,\ncast a quick glance upon the man who had terrified her so, and at once\nperceiving it was d’Artagnan, she uttered a cry of joy, “Oh, it is you,\nit is you! Thank God, thank God!”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Yes, it is I,” said d’Artagnan, “it is I, whom God has</p>",

It was chance that threw me in\nyour way; I saw a woman knocking at the window of one of my friends.”</p><p>“One of your friends?” interrupted Mme. Bonacieux.</p><p>“Without doubt; Aramis is one of my best friends.”</p><p>“Aramis! Who is he?”</p><p>“Come, come, you won’t tell me you don’t know Aramis?”</p><p>“This is the first time I ever heard his name pronounced.”</p>",

While he was listening to this recital, delivered with\nthe greatest simplicity, the duke looked from time to time at the young\nman with astonishment, as if he could not comprehend how so much\nprudence, courage, and devotedness could be allied with a countenance\nwhich indicated not more than twenty years.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The horses went like the wind, and in a few minutes they were at the\ngates of London.

  "page-539": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">rate, heedless about upsetting those whom he met on the road.

D’Artagnan did the same, with a\nlittle more concern, however, for the noble creatures, whose merits he\nfully appreciated; but he had the satisfaction of seeing three or four\ngrooms run from the kitchens and the stables, and busy themselves with\nthe steeds.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The duke walked so fast that d’Artagnan had some trouble in keeping up\nwith him. He passed through several apartments, of an elegance of which\neven the</p>",
  "page-540": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">greatest nobles of France had not even an idea, and arrived at\nlength in a bedchamber which was at once a miracle of taste and of\nrichness. In the alcove of this chamber was a door concealed in the\ntapestry which the duke opened with a little gold key which he wore\nsuspended from his neck by a chain of the same metal. With discretion\nd’Artagnan remained behind; but at the moment when Buckingham crossed\nthe threshold, he turned round, and seeing the hesitation of the young\nman, “Come in!” cried he, “and if you have the good fortune to be\nadmitted to her Majesty’s presence, tell her what you have seen.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Encouraged by this invitation, d’Artagnan followed the duke, who closed\nthe door after them.

  "page-541": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">by white and red plumes, was\na full-length portrait of Anne of Austria, so perfect in its resemblance\nthat d’Artagnan uttered a cry of surprise on beholding it. One might\nbelieve the queen was about to speak. On the altar, and beneath the\nportrait, was the casket containing the diamond studs.</p><p>The duke approached the altar, knelt as a priest might have done before\na crucifix, and opened the casket. “There,” said he, drawing from the\ncasket a large bow of blue ribbon all sparkling with diamonds, “there\nare the precious studs which I have taken an oath should be buried with\nme. The queen gave them to me, the queen requires them again. Her will\nbe done, like that of God, in all things.”</p><p>Then, he began to kiss, one after the other, those dear studs with which\nhe was about to part. All at once he uttered a terrible cry.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“What is the matter?” exclaimed d’Artagnan,</p>",
  "page-542": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">anxiously; “what has\nhappened to you, my Lord?”</p><p>“All is lost!” cried Buckingham, becoming as pale as a corpse; “two of\nthe studs are wanting, there are only ten.”</p><p>“Can you have lost them, my Lord, or do you think they have been\nstolen?”</p><p>“They have been stolen,” replied the duke, “and it is the cardinal who\nhas dealt this blow. Hold; see! The ribbons which held them have been\ncut with scissors.”</p><p>“If my Lord suspects they have been stolen, perhaps the person who stole\nthem still has them in his hands.”</p><p>“Wait, wait!” said the duke. “The only time I have worn these studs was\nat a ball given by the king eight days ago at Windsor. The Comtesse de\nWinter, with whom I had quarreled, became reconciled to me at that ball.\nThat reconciliation was nothing but the vengeance of a jealous woman. I\nhave never seen her from that day. The woman is an agent of the\ncardinal.”</p>",
  "page-543": "<p>“He has agents, then, throughout the world?” cried d’Artagnan.</p><p>“Oh, yes,” said Buckingham, grating his teeth with rage. “Yes, he is a\nterrible antagonist.

  "page-545": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">determined on war, and that this measure is\nmy first act of hostility against France.”</p><p>The secretary bowed and retired.</p><p>“We are safe on that side,” said Buckingham, turning toward d’Artagnan.\n“If the studs are not yet gone to Paris, they will not arrive till after\nyou.”</p><p>“How so?”</p><p>“I have just placed an embargo on all vessels at present in his\nMajesty’s ports, and without particular permission, not one dare lift an\nanchor.”</p><p>D’Artagnan looked with stupefaction at a man who thus employed the\nunlimited power with which he was clothed by the confidence of a king in\nthe prosecution of his intrigues. Buckingham saw by the expression of\nthe young man’s face what was passing in his mind, and he smiled.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Yes,” said he, “yes, Anne of Austria is my true queen.

It was to that obedience I owe her\nportrait.”</p><p>D’Artagnan was amazed to note by what fragile and unknown threads the\ndestinies of nations and the lives of men are suspended. He was lost in\nthese reflections when the goldsmith entered. He was an Irishman—one of\nthe most skillful of his craft, and who himself confessed that he gained\na hundred thousand livres a year by the Duke of Buckingham.</p><p>“Mr. O’Reilly,” said the duke, leading him into the chapel, “look at\nthese diamond studs, and tell me what they are worth apiece.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The goldsmith cast a glance at the elegant manner in</p>",
  "page-547": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">which they were\nset, calculated, one with another, what the diamonds were worth, and\nwithout hesitation said, “Fifteen hundred pistoles each, my Lord.”</p><p>“How many days would it require to make two studs exactly like them?

D’Artagnan even fancied he\ncould recognize amid this strange disorder, fragments of garments,</p>",

  "page-616": "<p>As d’Artagnan pursued his investigations, a more abundant and more icy\nsweat rolled in large drops from his forehead; his heart was oppressed\nby a horrible anguish; his respiration was broken and short.

  "page-621": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">gentleman that not\none of your words shall escape from my heart.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The old man read so much truth and so much grief in the face of the\nyoung man that he made him a sign to listen, and repeated in a low\nvoice: “It was scarcely nine o’clock when I heard a noise in the street,\nand was wondering what it could be, when on coming to my door, I found\nthat somebody was endeavoring to open it. As I am very poor and am not\nafraid of being robbed, I went and opened the gate and saw three men at\na few paces from it. In the shadow was a carriage with two horses, and\nsome saddlehorses. These horses evidently belonged to the three men, who\nwere dressed as cavaliers. ‘Ah, my worthy gentlemen,’ cried I, ‘what do\nyou want?’ ‘You must have a ladder?’ said he who appeared to be the\nleader of the party. ‘Yes, monsieur, the one with which I gather my\nfruit.’ ‘Lend it to us, and go into your house again; there is a crown\nfor the</p>",

Only remember this—if you speak a\nword of what you may see or what you may hear (for you will look and you\nwill listen, I am quite sure, however we may threaten you), you are\nlost.’ At these words he threw me a crown, which I picked up, and he\ntook the ladder. After shutting the gate behind them, I pretended to\nreturn to the house, but I immediately went out a back door, and\nstealing along in the shade of the hedge, I gained yonder clump of\nelder, from which I could hear and see everything. The three men brought\nthe carriage up quietly, and took out of it a little man, stout, short,\nelderly, and commonly dressed in clothes of a dark color, who ascended\nthe ladder very carefully, looked suspiciously in at the window of the\npavilion, came down as quietly as he had gone up, and whispered, ‘It is\nshe!’ Immediately, he who had spoken to me approached the door of the\npavilion, opened it with a key he had in his hand, closed the door</p>",
  "page-623": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">and\ndisappeared, while at the same time the other two men ascended the\nladder. The little old man remained at the coach door; the coachman took\ncare of his horses, the lackey held the saddlehorses. All at once great\ncries resounded in the pavilion, and a woman came to the window, and\nopened it, as if to throw herself out of it; but as soon as she\nperceived the other two men, she fell back and they went into the\nchamber. Then I saw no more; but I heard the noise of breaking\nfurniture. The woman screamed, and cried for help; but her cries were\nsoon stifled. Two of the men appeared, bearing the woman in their arms,\nand carried her to the carriage, into which the little old man got after\nher. The leader closed the window, came out an instant after by the\ndoor, and satisfied himself that the woman was in the carriage. His two\ncompanions were already on horseback. He sprang into his saddle; the\nlackey took his place by the coachman; the carriage went off at a</p>",
  "page-624": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">quick\npace, escorted by the three horsemen, and all was over. From that moment\nI have neither seen nor heard anything.”</p><p>D’Artagnan, entirely overcome by this terrible story, remained\nmotionless and mute, while all the demons of anger and jealousy were\nhowling in his heart.</p><p>“But, my good gentleman,” resumed the old man, upon whom this mute\ndespair certainly produced a greater effect than cries and tears would\nhave done, “do not take on so; they did not kill her, and that’s a\ncomfort.”</p><p>“Can you guess,” said d’Artagnan, “who was the man who headed this\ninfernal expedition?”</p><p>“I don’t know him.”</p><p>“But as you spoke to him you must have seen him.”</p><p>“Oh, it’s a description you want?”</p><p>“Exactly so.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“A tall, dark man, with black mustaches, dark eyes,</p>",

He was compelled, then, after\nhaving swallowed the contents of his bottle, to pass the time as well as\nto evade suspicion, to fall into the easiest position in his corner and\nto sleep, whether well or ill.

It is true that\nwhen a man</p>",
  "page-633": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">possesses a young and pretty wife, he has no need to seek\nhappiness elsewhere. Happiness comes to meet him, does it not, Monsieur\nBonacieux?”</p><p>Bonacieux became as pale as death, and grinned a ghastly smile.</p><p>“Ah, ah!” said Bonacieux, “you are a jocular companion! But where the\ndevil were you gladding last night, my young master? It does not appear\nto be very clean in the crossroads.”</p><p>D’Artagnan glanced down at his boots, all covered with mud; but that\nsame glance fell upon the shoes and stockings of the mercer, and it\nmight have been said they had been dipped in the same mud heap. Both\nwere stained with splashes of mud of the same appearance.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Then a sudden idea crossed the mind of d’Artagnan. That little stout\nman, short and elderly, that sort of lackey, dressed in dark clothes,\ntreated without ceremony by the men wearing swords who composed</p>",
  "page-634": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">the\nescort, was Bonacieux himself. The husband had presided at the abduction\nof his wife.</p><p>A terrible inclination seized d’Artagnan to grasp the mercer by the\nthroat and strangle him; but, as we have said, he was a very prudent\nyouth, and he restrained himself. However, the revolution which appeared\nupon his countenance was so visible that Bonacieux was terrified at it,\nand he endeavored to draw back a step or two; but as he was standing\nbefore the half of the door which was shut, the obstacle compelled him\nto keep his place.</p><p>“Ah, but you are joking, my worthy man!” said d’Artagnan. “It appears to\nme that if my boots need a sponge, your stockings and shoes stand in\nequal need of a brush. May you not have been philandering a little also,\nMonsieur Bonacieux? Oh, the devil! That’s unpardonable in a man of your\nage, and who besides, has such a pretty wife as yours.”</p>",
  "page-635": "<p>“Oh, Lord! no,” said Bonacieux, “but yesterday I went to St. Mande to\nmake some inquiries after a servant, as I cannot possibly do without\none; and the roads were so bad that I brought back all this mud, which I\nhave not yet had time to remove.”</p><p>The place named by Bonacieux as that which had been the object of his\njourney was a fresh proof in support of the suspicions d’Artagnan had\nconceived. Bonacieux had named Mande because Mande was in an exactly\nopposite direction from St. Cloud. This probability afforded him his\nfirst consolation. If Bonacieux knew where his wife was, one might, by\nextreme means, force the mercer to open his teeth and let his secret\nescape. The question, then, was how to change this probability into a\ncertainty.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Pardon, my dear Monsieur Bonacieux, if I don’t stand upon ceremony,”\nsaid d’Artagnan, “but nothing makes one so thirsty as want of sleep. I\nam parched with</p>",
  "page-636": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">thirst. Allow me to take a glass of water in your\napartment; you know that is never refused among neighbors.”</p><p>Without waiting for the permission of his host, d’Artagnan went quickly\ninto the house, and cast a rapid glance at the bed. It had not been\nused. Bonacieux had not been abed. He had only been back an hour or two;\nhe had accompanied his wife to the place of her confinement, or else at\nleast to the first relay.</p><p>“Thanks, Monsieur Bonacieux,” said d’Artagnan, emptying his glass, “that\nis all I wanted of you. I will now go up into my apartment. I will make\nPlanchet brush my boots; and when he has done, I will, if you like, send\nhim to you to brush your shoes.”</p><p>He left the mercer quite astonished at his singular farewell, and asking\nhimself if he had not been a little inconsiderate.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">At the top of the stairs he found Planchet in a great</p>",
  "page-637": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">fright.</p><p>“Ah, monsieur!” cried Planchet, as soon as he perceived his master,\n“here is more trouble. I thought you would never come in.”</p><p>“What’s the matter now, Planchet?” demanded d’Artagnan.</p><p>“Oh! I give you a hundred, I give you a thousand times to guess,\nmonsieur, the visit I received in your absence.”</p><p>“When?”</p><p>“About half an hour ago, while you were at Monsieur de Treville’s.”</p><p>“Who has been here? Come, speak.”</p><p>“Monsieur de Cavois.”</p><p>“Monsieur de Cavois?”</p><p>“In person.”</p><p>“The captain of the cardinal’s Guards?”</p><p>“Himself.”</p>",
  "page-638": "<p>“Did he come to arrest me?”</p><p>“I have no doubt that he did, monsieur, for all his wheedling manner.”</p><p>“Was he so sweet, then?”</p><p>“Indeed, he was all honey, monsieur.”</p><p>“Indeed!”</p><p>“He came, he said, on the part of his Eminence, who wished you well, and\nto beg you to follow him to the Palais-Royal*.”</p><pre><code>_*It was called the Palais-Cardinal before Richelieu gave it to</code></pre><p>the King._</p><p>“What did you answer him?”</p><p>“That the thing was impossible, seeing that you were not at home, as he\ncould see.”</p><p>“Well, what did he say then?”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“That you must not fail to call upon him in the course of the day; and\nthen he added in a low voice, ‘Tell</p>",

The falsehood would then lie at my door, and as I am not a\ngentleman, I may be allowed to lie.”</p>",
  "page-640": "<p>“Be of good heart, Planchet, you shall preserve your reputation as a\nveracious man. In a quarter of an hour we set off.”</p><p>“That’s the advice I was about to give Monsieur; and where are we going,\nmay I ask, without being too curious?”</p><p>“PARDIEU! In the opposite direction to that which you said I was gone.\nBesides, are you not as anxious to learn news of Grimaud, Mousqueton,\nand Bazin as I am to know what has become of Athos, Porthos, and\nAramis?”</p><p>“Yes, monsieur,” said Planchet, “and I will go as soon as you please.\nIndeed, I think provincial air will suit us much better just now than\nthe air of Paris. So then—”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“So then, pack up our luggage, Planchet, and let us be off. On my part,\nI will go out with my hands in my pockets, that nothing may be\nsuspected.

  "page-641": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">me at the Hotel des Gardes. By the way,\nPlanchet, I think you are right with respect to our host, and that he is\ndecidedly a frightfully low wretch.”</p><p>“Ah, monsieur, you may take my word when I tell you anything. I am a\nphysiognomist, I assure you.”</p><p>D’Artagnan went out first, as had been agreed upon. Then, in order that\nhe might have nothing to reproach himself with, he directed his steps,\nfor the last time, toward the residences of his three friends. No news\nhad been received of them; only a letter, all perfumed and of an elegant\nwriting in small characters, had come for Aramis. D’Artagnan took charge\nof it. Ten minutes afterward Planchet joined him at the stables of the\nHotel des Gardes. D’Artagnan, in order that there might be no time lost,\nhad saddled his horse himself.</p><p>“That’s well,” said he to Planchet, when the latter added the\nportmanteau to the equipment. “Now saddle the other three horses.”</p>",
  "page-642": "<p>“Do you think, then, monsieur, that we shall travel faster with two\nhorses apiece?” said Planchet, with his shrewd air.</p><p>“No, Monsieur Jester,” replied d’Artagnan; “but with our four horses we\nmay bring back our three friends, if we should have the good fortune to\nfind them living.”</p><p>“Which is a great chance,” replied Planchet, “but we must not despair of\nthe mercy of God.”</p><p>“Amen!” said d’Artagnan, getting into his saddle.</p><p>As they went from the Hotel des Gardes, they separated, leaving the\nstreet at opposite ends, one having to quit Paris by the Barriere de la\nVillette and the other by the Barriere Montmartre, to meet again beyond\nSt. Denis—a strategic maneuver which, having been executed with equal\npunctuality, was crowned with the most fortunate results. D’Artagnan and\nPlanchet entered Pierrefitte together.</p>",
  "page-643": "<p>Planchet was more courageous, it must be admitted, by day than by night.\nHis natural prudence, however, never forsook him for a single instant.\nHe had forgotten not one of the incidents of the first journey, and he\nlooked upon everybody he met on the road as an enemy. It followed that\nhis hat was forever in his hand, which procured him some severe\nreprimands from d’Artagnan, who feared that his excess of politeness\nwould lead people to think he was the lackey of a man of no consequence.</p><p>Nevertheless, whether the passengers were really touched by the urbanity\nof Planchet or whether this time nobody was posted on the young man’s\nroad, our two travelers arrived at Chantilly without any accident, and\nalighted at the tavern of Great St. Martin, the same at which they had\nstopped on their first journey.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The host, on seeing a young man followed by a lackey with two extra\nhorses, advanced respectfully to</p>",
  "page-644": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">the door. Now, as they had already\ntraveled eleven leagues, d’Artagnan thought it time to stop, whether\nPorthos were or were not in the inn. Perhaps it would not be prudent to\nask at once what had become of the Musketeer. The result of these\nreflections was that d’Artagnan, without asking information of any kind,\nalighted, commended the horses to the care of his lackey, entered a\nsmall room destined to receive those who wished to be alone, and desired\nthe host to bring him a bottle of his best wine and as good a breakfast\nas possible—a desire which further corroborated the high opinion the\ninnkeeper had formed of the traveler at first sight.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">D’Artagnan was therefore served with miraculous celerity.

  "page-645": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">uniform, could not\nfail to make a sensation. The host desired himself to serve him; which\nd’Artagnan perceiving, ordered two glasses to be brought, and commenced\nthe following conversation.</p><p>“My faith, my good host,” said d’Artagnan, filling the two glasses, “I\nasked for a bottle of your best wine, and if you have deceived me, you\nwill be punished in what you have sinned; for seeing that I hate\ndrinking by myself, you shall drink with me. Take your glass, then, and\nlet us drink. But what shall we drink to, so as to avoid wounding any\nsusceptibility? Let us drink to the prosperity of your establishment.”</p><p>“Your Lordship does me much honor,” said the host, “and I thank you\nsincerely for your kind wish.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“But don’t mistake,” said d’Artagnan, “there is more selfishness in my\ntoast than perhaps you may think—for it is only in prosperous\nestablishments that one is well received.

  "page-646": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">is in confusion, and the traveler is a victim to\nthe embarrassments of his host. Now, I travel a great deal, particularly\non this road, and I wish to see all innkeepers making a fortune.”</p><p>“It seems to me,” said the host, “that this is not the first time I have\nhad the honor of seeing Monsieur.”</p><p>“Bah, I have passed perhaps ten times through Chantilly, and out of the\nten times I have stopped three or four times at your house at least. Why\nI was here only ten or twelve days ago. I was conducting some friends,\nMusketeers, one of whom, by the by, had a dispute with a stranger—a man\nwho sought a quarrel with him, for I don’t know what.”</p><p>“Exactly so,” said the host; “I remember it perfectly. It is not\nMonsieur Porthos that your Lordship means?”</p><p>“Yes, that is my companion’s name. My God, my dear host, tell me if\nanything has happened to him?”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Your Lordship must have observed that he could</p>",
  "page-647": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">not continue his\njourney.”</p><p>“Why, to be sure, he promised to rejoin us, and we have seen nothing of\nhim.”</p><p>“He has done us the honor to remain here.”</p><p>“What, he had done you the honor to remain here?”</p><p>“Yes, monsieur, in this house; and we are even a little uneasy—”</p><p>“On what account?”</p><p>“Of certain expenses he has contracted.”</p><p>“Well, but whatever expenses he may have incurred, I am sure he is in a\ncondition to pay them.”</p><p>“Ah, monsieur, you infuse genuine balm into my blood. We have made\nconsiderable advances; and this very morning the surgeon declared that\nif Monsieur Porthos did not pay him, he should look to me, as it was I\nwho had sent for him.”</p><p>“Porthos is wounded, then?”</p><p>“I cannot tell you, monsieur.”</p>",
  "page-648": "<p>“What! You cannot tell me?

Take the stairs on your right; go up the first\nflight and knock at Number One. Only warn him that it is you.”</p><p>“Why should I do that?”</p><p>“Because, monsieur, some mischief might happen to you.”</p><p>“Of what kind, in the name of wonder?”</p><p>“Monsieur Porthos may imagine you belong to the house, and in a fit of\npassion might run his sword through you or blow out your brains.”</p><p>“What have you done to him, then?”</p><p>“We have asked him for money.”</p>",
  "page-649": "<p>“The devil! Ah, I can understand that. It is a demand that Porthos takes\nvery ill when he is not in funds; but I know he must be so at present.”</p><p>“We thought so, too, monsieur. As our house is carried on very\nregularly, and we make out our bills every week, at the end of eight\ndays we presented our account; but it appeared we had chosen an unlucky\nmoment, for at the first word on the subject, he sent us to all the\ndevils. It is true he had been playing the day before.”</p><p>“Playing the day before! And with whom?”</p><p>“Lord, who can say, monsieur? With some gentleman who was traveling this\nway, to whom he proposed a game of LANSQUENET.”</p><p>“That’s it, then, and the foolish fellow lost all he had?”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Even to his horse, monsieur; for when the gentleman was about to set\nout, we perceived that his</p>",
  "page-650": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">lackey was saddling Monsieur Porthos’s horse,\nas well as his master’s. When we observed this to him, he told us all to\ntrouble ourselves about our own business, as this horse belonged to him.\nWe also informed Monsieur Porthos of what was going on; but he told us\nwe were scoundrels to doubt a gentleman’s word, and that as he had said\nthe horse was his, it must be so.”</p><p>“That’s Porthos all over,” murmured d’Artagnan.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Then,” continued the host, “I replied that as from the moment we seemed\nnot likely to come to a good understanding with respect to payment, I\nhoped that he would have at least the kindness to grant the favor of his\ncustom to my brother host of the Golden Eagle; but Monsieur Porthos\nreplied that, my house being the best, he should remain where he was.\nThis reply was too flattering to allow me to insist on his departure. I\nconfined myself then to begging him to give up his chamber, which is the\nhandsomest in the hotel, and to</p>",
  "page-651": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">be satisfied with a pretty little room\non the third floor; but to this Monsieur Porthos replied that as he\nevery moment expected his mistress, who was one of the greatest ladies\nin the court, I might easily comprehend that the chamber he did me the\nhonor to occupy in my house was itself very mean for the visit of such a\npersonage. Nevertheless, while acknowledging the truth of what he said,\nI thought proper to insist; but without even giving himself the trouble\nto enter into any discussion with me, he took one of his pistols, laid\nit on his table, day and night, and said that at the first word that\nshould be spoken to him about removing, either within the house or out\nof it, he would blow out the brains of the person who should be so\nimprudent as to meddle with a matter which only concerned himself. Since\nthat time, monsieur, nobody entered his chamber but his servant.”</p><p>“What! Mousqueton is here, then?”</p>",
  "page-652": "<p>“Oh, yes, monsieur. Five days after your departure, he came back, and in\na very bad condition, too. It appears that he had met with\ndisagreeableness, likewise, on his journey.

  "page-762": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">All this doubt only gave rise to a more lively\ndesire of arriving at a certainty, and he went into his friend’s chamber\nwith a fixed determination of renewing the conversation of the preceding\nevening; but he found Athos quite himself again—that is to say, the\nmost shrewd and impenetrable of men. Besides which, the Musketeer, after\nhaving exchanged a hearty shake of the hand with him, broached the\nmatter first.</p><p>“I was pretty drunk yesterday, d’Artagnan,” said he, “I can tell that by\nmy tongue, which was swollen and hot this morning, and by my pulse,\nwhich was very tremulous.

That is my failing—a capital\nfailing, I admit; but with that exception, I am a good drinker.”</p><p>Athos spoke this in so natural a manner that d’Artagnan was shaken in\nhis conviction.</p><p>“It is that, then,” replied the young man, anxious to find out the\ntruth, “it is that, then, I remember as we remember a dream.

She then made an\nextraordinary effort to receive him, but never did a more distressed\ncountenance give the lie to a more amiable smile.</p><p>To the questions which d’Artagnan put concerning her health, she\nreplied, “Bad, very bad.”</p><p>“Then,” replied he, “my visit is ill-timed; you, no doubt, stand in need\nof repose, and I will withdraw.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“No, no!” said Milady. “On the contrary, stay,</p>",

At the same time the fever, which for an\ninstant abandoned her, returned to give luster to her eyes, color to her\ncheeks, and vermillion to her lips. D’Artagnan was again in the presence\nof the Circe who had before surrounded him with her enchantments. His\nlove, which he believed to be extinct but which was only asleep, awoke\nagain in his heart. Milady smiled, and d’Artagnan felt that he could\ndamn himself for that smile. There was a moment at which he felt\nsomething like remorse.</p><p>By degrees, Milady became more communicative.

  "page-956": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">to\nhave an opportunity of reading his own thoughts and endeavoring, if\npossible, to fathom those of this woman.</p><p>What was most clear in the matter was that d’Artagnan loved Milady like\na madman, and that she did not love him at all. In an instant d’Artagnan\nperceived that the best way in which he could act would be to go home\nand write Milady a long letter, in which he would confess to her that he\nand de Wardes were, up to the present moment absolutely the same, and\nthat consequently he could not undertake, without committing suicide, to\nkill the Comte de Wardes. But he also was spurred on by a ferocious\ndesire of vengeance. He wished to subdue this woman in his own name; and\nas this vengeance appeared to him to have a certain sweetness in it, he\ncould not make up his mind to renounce it.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">He walked six or seven times round the Place</p>",
  "page-957": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Royale, turning at every\nten steps to look at the light in Milady’s apartment, which was to be\nseen through the blinds. It was evident that this time the young woman\nwas not in such haste to retire to her apartment as she had been the\nfirst.</p><p>At length the light disappeared. With this light was extinguished the\nlast irresolution in the heart of d’Artagnan. He recalled to his mind\nthe details of the first night, and with a beating heart and a brain on\nfire he re-entered the hotel and flew toward Kitty’s chamber.</p><p>The poor girl, pale as death and trembling in all her limbs, wished to\ndelay her lover; but Milady, with her ear on the watch, had heard the\nnoise d’Artagnan had made, and opening the door, said, “Come in.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">All this was of such incredible immodesty, of such monstrous effrontery,\nthat d’Artagnan could scarcely believe what he saw or what he heard. He\nimagined</p>",
  "page-958": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">himself to be drawn into one of those fantastic intrigues one\nmeets in dreams. He, however, darted not the less quickly toward Milady,\nyielding to that magnetic attraction which the loadstone exercises over\niron.</p><p>As the door closed after them Kitty rushed toward it. Jealousy, fury,\noffended pride, all the passions in short that dispute the heart of an\noutraged woman in love, urged her to make a revelation; but she\nreflected that she would be totally lost if she confessed having\nassisted in such a machination, and above all, that d’Artagnan would\nalso be lost to her forever. This last thought of love counseled her to\nmake this last sacrifice.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">D’Artagnan, on his part, had gained the summit of all his wishes. It was\nno longer a rival who was beloved; it was himself who was apparently\nbeloved. A secret voice whispered to him, at the bottom of his heart,\nthat he was but an instrument of vengeance, that he was only caressed\ntill he had given death; but pride, but</p>",
  "page-959": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">self-love, but madness silenced\nthis voice and stifled its murmurs. And then our Gascon, with that large\nquantity of conceit which we know he possessed, compared himself with de\nWardes, and asked himself why, after all, he should not be beloved for\nhimself?</p><p>He was absorbed entirely by the sensations of the moment. Milady was no\nlonger for him that woman of fatal intentions who had for a moment\nterrified him; she was an ardent, passionate mistress, abandoning\nherself to love which she also seemed to feel. Two hours thus glided\naway. When the transports of the two lovers were calmer, Milady, who had\nnot the same motives for forgetfulness that d’Artagnan had, was the\nfirst to return to reality, and asked the young man if the means which\nwere on the morrow to bring on the encounter between him and de Wardes\nwere already arranged in his mind.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">But d’Artagnan, whose ideas had taken quite</p>",

  "page-961": "<p>“You cannot think so, dear love!” replied d’Artagnan; “but now, suppose\nthis poor Comte de Wardes were less guilty than you think him?”</p><p>“At all events,” said Milady, seriously, “he has deceived me, and from\nthe moment he deceived me, he merited death.”</p><p>“He shall die, then, since you condemn him!” said d’Artagnan, in so firm\na tone that it appeared to Milady an undoubted proof of devotion. This\nreassured her.</p><p>We cannot say how long the night seemed to Milady, but d’Artagnan\nbelieved it to be hardly two hours before the daylight peeped through\nthe window blinds, and invaded the chamber with its paleness. Seeing\nd’Artagnan about to leave her, Milady recalled his promise to avenge her\non the Comte de Wardes.</p><p>“I am quite ready,” said d’Artagnan; “but in the first place I should\nlike to be certain of one thing.”</p><p>“And what is that?” asked Milady.</p>",
  "page-962": "<p>“That is, whether you really love me?”</p><p>“I have given you proof of that, it seems to me.”</p><p>“And I am yours, body and soul!”</p><p>“Thanks, my brave lover; but as you are satisfied of my love, you must,\nin your turn, satisfy me of yours. Is it not so?”</p><p>“Certainly; but if you love me as much as you say,” replied d’Artagnan,\n“do you not entertain a little fear on my account?”</p><p>“What have I to fear?”</p><p>“Why, that I may be dangerously wounded—killed even.”</p><p>“Impossible!” cried Milady, “you are such a valiant man, and such an\nexpert swordsman.”</p><p>“You would not, then, prefer a method,” resumed d’Artagnan, “which would\nequally avenge you while rendering the combat useless?”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Milady looked at her lover in silence.

I think that a man must be so\nseverely punished by the loss of your love that he stands in need of no\nother chastisement.”</p><p>“Who told you that I loved him?” asked Milady, sharply.</p><p>“At least, I am now at liberty to believe, without too much fatuity,\nthat you love another,” said the young man, in a caressing tone, “and I\nrepeat that I am really interested for the count.”</p><p>“You?” asked Milady.</p><p>“Yes, I.”</p><p>“And why YOU?”</p>",
  "page-964": "<p>“Because I alone know—”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“That he is far from being, or rather having been, so guilty toward you\nas he appears.”</p><p>“Indeed!” said Milady, in an anxious tone; “explain yourself, for I\nreally cannot tell what you mean.”</p><p>And she looked at d’Artagnan, who embraced her tenderly, with eyes which\nseemed to burn themselves away.</p><p>“Yes; I am a man of honor,” said d’Artagnan, determined to come to an\nend, “and since your love is mine, and I am satisfied I possess it—for\nI do possess it, do I not?”</p><p>“Entirely; go on.”</p><p>“Well, I feel as if transformed—a confession weighs on my mind.”</p><p>“A confession!”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“If I had the least doubt of your love I would not</p>",

It is not true,” said Milady, in a tone of voice so firm, and\nwith a countenance so unchanged, that if d’Artagnan had not been in such\nperfect possession of the fact, he would have doubted.</p><p>“Do not lie, my angel,” said d’Artagnan, smiling; “that would be\nuseless.”</p>",
  "page-966": "<p>“What do you mean?

You told me yourself that that ring—”</p><p>“That ring I have!

The Musketeer met with a\nsuperb Andalusian horse, black as jet, nostrils of fire, legs clean and\nelegant, rising six years. He examined him, and found him sound and\nwithout blemish.

What is it, Grimaud?\nConsidering the gravity of the occasion, I permit you to speak, my\nfriend; but be laconic, I beg. What do you see?”</p><p>“A troop.”</p>",
  "page-1163": "<p>“Of how many persons?”</p><p>“Twenty men.”</p><p>“What sort of men?”</p><p>“Sixteen pioneers, four soldiers.”</p><p>“How far distant?”</p><p>“Five hundred paces.”</p><p>“Good! We have just time to finish this fowl and to drink one glass of\nwine to your health, d’Artagnan.”</p><p>“To your health!” repeated Porthos and Aramis.</p><p>“Well, then, to my health! although I am very much afraid that your good\nwishes will not be of great service to me.”</p><p>“Bah!” said Athos, “God is great, as say the followers of Mohammed, and\nthe future is in his hands.”</p><p>Then, swallowing the contents of his glass, which he put down close to\nhim, Athos arose carelessly, took the musket next to him, and drew near\nto one of the loopholes.</p>",
  "page-1164": "<p>Porthos, Aramis and d’Artagnan followed his example. As to Grimaud, he\nreceived orders to place himself behind the four friends in order to\nreload their weapons.</p><p>“Pardieu!” said Athos, “it was hardly worth while to distribute\nourselves for twenty fellows armed with pickaxes, mattocks, and shovels.\nGrimaud had only to make them a sign to go away, and I am convinced they\nwould have left us in peace.”</p><p>“I doubt that,” replied d’Artagnan, “for they are advancing very\nresolutely. Besides, in addition to the pioneers, there are four\nsoldiers and a brigadier, armed with muskets.”</p><p>“That’s because they don’t see us,” said Athos.</p><p>“My faith,” said Aramis, “I must confess I feel a great repugnance to\nfire on these poor devils of civilians.”</p><p>“He is a bad priest,” said Porthos, “who has pity for heretics.”</p>",
  "page-1165": "<p>“In truth,” said Athos, “Aramis is right. I will warn them.”</p><p>“What the devil are you going to do?” cried d’Artagnan, “you will be\nshot.”</p><p>But Athos heeded not his advice. Mounting on the breach, with his musket\nin one hand and his hat in the other, he said, bowing courteously and\naddressing the soldiers and the pioneers, who, astonished at this\napparition, stopped fifty paces from the bastion: “Gentlemen, a few\nfriends and myself are about to breakfast in this bastion. Now, you know\nnothing is more disagreeable than being disturbed when one is at\nbreakfast. We request you, then, if you really have business here, to\nwait till we have finished our repast, or to come again a short time\nhence; unless, which would be far better, you form the salutary\nresolution to quit the side of the rebels, and come and drink with us to\nthe health of the King of France.”</p>",

On their part, the three friends had\nreloaded their arms; a second discharge followed the first. The\nbrigadier and two pioneers fell dead; the rest of the troop took to\nflight.</p><p>“Now, gentlemen, a sortie!” cried Athos.</p>",
  "page-1167": "<p>And the four friends rushed out of the fort, gained the field of battle,\npicked up the four muskets of the privates and the half-pike of the\nbrigadier, and convinced that the fugitives would not stop till they\nreached the city, turned again toward the bastion, bearing with them the\ntrophies of their victory.</p><p>“Reload the muskets, Grimaud,” said Athos, “and we, gentlemen, will go\non with our breakfast, and resume our conversation.

The\ncardinal will remember that these are the same men</p>",

If they continue to advance, we\nmust fire again. We must fire as long as we have loaded guns. If those\nwho remain of the troop persist in coming to the assault, we will allow\nthe besiegers to get as far as the ditch, and then we will push down\nupon their heads that strip of wall which keeps its perpendicular by a\nmiracle.”</p><p>“Bravo!” cried Porthos. “Decidedly, Athos, you were born to be a\ngeneral, and the cardinal, who fancies himself a great soldier, is\nnothing beside you.”</p>",
  "page-1175": "<p>“Gentlemen,” said Athos, “no divided attention, I beg; let each one pick\nout his man.”</p><p>“I cover mine,” said d’Artagnan.</p><p>“And I mine,” said Porthos.</p><p>“And I mine,” said Aramis.</p><p>“Fire, then,” said Athos.</p><p>The four muskets made but one report, but four men fell.</p><p>The drum immediately beat, and the little troop advanced at charging\npace.</p><p>Then the shots were repeated without regularity, but always aimed with\nthe same accuracy.

  "page-1178": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">What you would now do amounts to\ntreason.”</p><p>D’Artagnan perceived the force of this reasoning, and was silent.</p><p>“But,” said Porthos, “I think I have an idea, in my turn.”</p><p>“Silence for Monsieur Porthos’s idea!” said Aramis.</p><p>“I will ask leave of absence of Monsieur de Treville, on some pretext or\nother which you must invent; I am not very clever at pretexts.

Her hands clutched her armchair;\nshe ground her teeth inwardly; her eyes followed the motion of the door\nas it closed behind Lord de Winter and Felton, and the moment she was\nalone a fresh fit of despair seized her.

  "page-1326": "<p>“For all my tears, my cares, My exile, and my chains, I have my youth,\nmy prayers, And God, who counts my pains.”</p><p>Her voice, of immense power and sublime expression, gave to the rude,\nunpolished poetry of these psalms a magic and an effect which the most\nexalted Puritans rarely found in the songs of their brethren, and which\nthey were forced to ornament with all the resources of their\nimagination. Felton believed he heard the singing of the angel who\nconsoled the three Hebrews in the furnace.</p><p>Milady continued:</p><p>“One day our doors will ope, With God come our desire; And if betrays\nthat hope, To death we can aspire.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">This verse, into which the terrible enchantress threw her whole soul,\ncompleted the trouble which had seized the heart of the young officer.\nHe opened the door</p>",

In that case Felton would escape her—for in order\nto secure success, the magic of a continuous seduction was necessary.\nNevertheless, as we have said, one circumstance reassured her.

  "page-1349": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">sonorous—vibrated as\nharmoniously and as affectingly as ever, the door remained shut. It\nappeared however to Milady that in one of the furtive glances she darted\nfrom time to time at the grating of the door she thought she saw the\nardent eyes of the young man through the narrow opening. But whether\nthis was reality or vision, he had this time sufficient self-command not\nto enter.</p><p>However, a few instants after she had finished her religious song,\nMilady thought she heard a profound sigh.

At the noise Felton made in\nentering, Milady leaped lightly to the</p>",
  "page-1350": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">ground, and tried to conceal\nbehind her the improvised cord she held in her hand.</p><p>The young man was more pale than usual, and his eyes, reddened by want\nof sleep, denoted that he had passed a feverish night. Nevertheless, his\nbrow was armed with a severity more austere than ever.</p><p>He advanced slowly toward Milady, who had seated herself, and taking an\nend of the murderous rope which by neglect, or perhaps by design, she\nallowed to be seen, “What is this, madame?” he asked coldly.</p><p>“That? Nothing,” said Milady, smiling with that painful expression which\nshe knew so well how to give to her smile. “Ennui is the mortal enemy of\nprisoners; I had ennui, and I amused myself with twisting that rope.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Felton turned his eyes toward the part of the wall of the apartment\nbefore which he had found Milady standing in the armchair in which she\nwas now seated,</p>",
  "page-1351": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">and over her head he perceived a gilt-headed screw,\nfixed in the wall for the purpose of hanging up clothes or weapons.</p><p>He started, and the prisoner saw that start—for though her eyes were\ncast down, nothing escaped her.</p><p>“What were you doing on that armchair?” asked he.</p><p>“Of what consequence?” replied Milady.</p><p>“But,” replied Felton, “I wish to know.”</p><p>“Do not question me,” said the prisoner; “you know that we who are true\nChristians are forbidden to lie.”</p><p>“Well, then,” said Felton, “I will tell you what you were doing, or\nrather what you meant to do; you were going to complete the fatal\nproject you cherish in your mind. Remember, madame, if our God forbids\nfalsehood, he much more severely condemns suicide.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“When God sees one of his creatures persecuted unjustly, placed between\nsuicide and dishonor, believe me, sir,” replied Milady, in a tone of\ndeep conviction,</p>",
  "page-1352": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">“God pardons suicide, for then suicide becomes\nmartyrdom.”</p><p>“You say either too much or too little; speak, madame.

And provided you produce a carcass that may be recognized as\nmine, they will require no more of you; nay, perhaps you will even have\na double reward.”</p><p>“I, madame, I?” cried Felton. “You suppose that I would ever accept the\nprice of your life?

In\na few days you will be away from this place; your life, madame, will\nthen no longer be under my care, and,” added he, with a sigh, “then you\ncan do what you will with it.”</p><p>“So,” cried Milady, as if she could not resist giving utterance to a\nholy indignation, “you, a pious man, you who are called a just man, you\nask but one thing—and that is that you may not be inculpated, annoyed,\nby my death!”</p><p>“It is my duty to watch over your life, madame, and I will watch.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“But do you understand the mission you are fulfilling?

You are not willing\nthat I should kill my body, and you make yourself the agent of him who\nwould kill my soul.”</p><p>“But I repeat it again to you,” replied Felton, in great emotion, “no\ndanger threatens you; I will answer for Lord de Winter as for myself.”</p><p>“Dunce,” cried Milady, “dunce! who dares to answer for another man, when\nthe wisest, when those most after God’s own heart, hesitate to answer\nfor themselves, and who ranges himself on the side of the strongest and\nthe most fortunate, to crush the weakest and the most unfortunate.”</p>",
  "page-1355": "<p>“Impossible, madame, impossible,” murmured Felton, who felt to the\nbottom of his heart the justness of this argument. “A prisoner, you will\nnot recover your liberty through me; living, you will not lose your life\nthrough me.”</p><p>“Yes,” cried Milady, “but I shall lose that which is much dearer to me\nthan life, I shall lose my honor, Felton; and it is you, you whom I make\nresponsible, before God and before men, for my shame and my infamy.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">This time Felton, immovable as he was, or appeared to be, could not\nresist the secret influence which had already taken possession of him.\nTo see this woman, so beautiful, fair as the brightest vision, to see\nher by turns overcome with grief and threatening; to resist at once the\nascendancy of grief and beauty—it was too much for a visionary; it was\ntoo much for a brain weakened by the ardent dreams of an ecstatic faith;\nit was too much</p>",
  "page-1356": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">for a heart furrowed by the love of heaven that burns,\nby the hatred of men that devours.</p><p>Milady saw the trouble. She felt by intuition the flame of the opposing\npassions which burned with the blood in the veins of the young fanatic.\nAs a skillful general, seeing the enemy ready to surrender, marches\ntoward him with a cry of victory, she rose, beautiful as an antique\npriestess, inspired like a Christian virgin, her arms extended, her\nthroat uncovered, her hair disheveled, holding with one hand her robe\nmodestly drawn over her breast, her look illumined by that fire which\nhad already created such disorder in the veins of the young Puritan, and\nwent toward him, crying out with a vehement air, and in her melodious\nvoice, to which on this occasion she communicated a terrible energy:</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Let this victim to Baal be sent, To the lions the martyr be thrown!

  "page-1359": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">and started as if\nits light had revealed the abysses of this woman’s heart. He recalled,\nall at once, the warnings of Lord de Winter, the seductions of Milady,\nher first attempts after her arrival. He drew back a step, and hung down\nhis head, without, however, ceasing to look at her, as if, fascinated by\nthis strange creature, he could not detach his eyes from her eyes.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Milady was not a woman to misunderstand the meaning of this hesitation.\nUnder her apparent emotions her icy coolness never abandoned her. Before\nFelton replied, and before she should be forced to resume this\nconversation, so difficult to be sustained in the same exalted tone, she\nlet her hands fall; and as if the weakness of the woman overpowered the\nenthusiasm of the inspired fanatic, she said: “But no, it is not for me\nto be the Judith to deliver Bethulia from this Holofernes. The sword of\nthe eternal is too heavy for my arm. Allow me, then, to avoid dishonor\nby death; let me take refuge</p>",
  "page-1360": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">in martyrdom. I do not ask you for liberty,\nas a guilty one would, nor for vengeance, as would a pagan. Let me die;\nthat is all. I supplicate you, I implore you on my knees—let me die,\nand my last sigh shall be a blessing for my preserver.”</p><p>Hearing that voice, so sweet and suppliant, seeing that look, so timid\nand downcast, Felton reproached himself. By degrees the enchantress had\nclothed herself with that magic adornment which she assumed and threw\naside at will; that is to say, beauty, meekness, and tears—and above\nall, the irresistible attraction of mystical voluptuousness, the most\ndevouring of all voluptuousness.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Alas!” said Felton, “I can do but one thing, which is to pity you if\nyou prove to me you are a victim!

  "page-1361": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">anyone\nbut my benefactor—I who have met with nothing but traitors and impious\nmen.

Oh,” continued\nshe, placing her hand modestly over her beautiful eyes, “never!\nnever!—I could not!”</p><p>“To me, to a brother?” said Felton.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Milady looked at him for some time with an expression which the young\nman took for doubt, but</p>",
  "page-1362": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">which, however, was nothing but observation, or\nrather the wish to fascinate.</p><p>Felton, in his turn a suppliant, clasped his hands.</p><p>“Well, then,” said Milady, “I confide in my brother; I will dare to—”</p><p>At this moment the steps of Lord de Winter were heard; but this time the\nterrible brother-in-law of Milady did not content himself, as on the\npreceding day, with passing before the door and going away again. He\npaused, exchanged two words with the sentinel; then the door opened, and\nhe appeared.</p><p>During the exchange of these two words Felton drew back quickly, and\nwhen Lord de Winter entered, he was several paces from the prisoner.</p><p>The baron entered slowly, sending a scrutinizing glance from Milady to\nthe young officer.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“You have been here a very long time, John,” said he. “Has this woman\nbeen relating her crimes to you?

  "page-1363": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">that case I can comprehend the\nlength of the conversation.”</p><p>Felton started; and Milady felt she was lost if she did not come to the\nassistance of the disconcerted Puritan.</p><p>“Ah, you fear your prisoner should escape!” said she. “Well, ask your\nworthy jailer what favor I this instant solicited of him.”</p><p>“You demanded a favor?” said the baron, suspiciously.</p><p>“Yes, my Lord,” replied the young man, confused.</p><p>“And what favor, pray?” asked Lord de Winter.</p><p>“A knife, which she would return to me through the grating of the door a\nminute after she had received it,” replied Felton.</p><p>“There is someone, then, concealed here whose throat this amiable lady\nis desirous of cutting,” said de Winter, in an ironical, contemptuous\ntone.</p><p>“There is myself,” replied Milady.</p>",
  "page-1364": "<p>“I have given you the choice between America and Tyburn,” replied Lord\nde Winter. “Choose Tyburn, madame. Believe me, the cord is more certain\nthan the knife.”</p><p>Felton grew pale, and made a step forward, remembering that at the\nmoment he entered Milady had a rope in her hand.</p><p>“You are right,” said she, “I have often thought of it.” Then she added\nin a low voice, “And I will think of it again.”</p><p>Felton felt a shudder run to the marrow of his bones; probably Lord de\nWinter perceived this emotion.</p><p>“Mistrust yourself, John,” said he. “I have placed reliance upon you, my\nfriend.

De Winter has changed his usual stupidity into a\nstrange prudence. It is the desire of vengeance, and how desire molds a\nman! As to Felton, he hesitates. Ah, he is not a man like that cursed\nd’Artagnan. A Puritan only adores virgins, and he adores them by\nclasping his hands. A Musketeer loves women, and he loves them by\nclasping his arms round them.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Milady waited, then, with much impatience, for she feared the day would\npass away without her seeing</p>",
  "page-1366": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Felton again. At last, in an hour after the\nscene we have just described, she heard someone speaking in a low voice\nat the door.

  "page-1368": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">me again.

To be a woman condemned to a painful and disgraceful\npunishment is no impediment to beauty, but it is an</p>",
  "page-1372": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">obstacle to the\nrecovery of power. Like all persons of real genius, Milady knew what\nsuited her nature and her means.

To lose a year, two years, three years,\nis to talk of an eternity; to return after the death or disgrace of the\ncardinal, perhaps; to return when d’Artagnan and his friends, happy and\ntriumphant, should have received from the queen the</p>",
